Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks

You could use the start and end as two stacks, with operations such as append, insert, delete, and pop

You could use the midddle of the array as a third stack, although this begins to get squirrly as the array len decreases and 
I am not sure what would happen if an array with an even amount of elements were accessed for the middle element, this would need 
to be accounted for
